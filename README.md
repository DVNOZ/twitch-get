Example website using justin/twitch old API.
With this you can download past broadcasted VODs. Currently also works with subscriber-only vods.
This was a personal exercise in jquery and bootstrap.

Hope you can use it. Thanks. Bye.

Live example on my portfolio site here:
[Twitch-Get](http://s√∏rensen.io/projects/twitch-get/)

Update: Doesn't work anymore. justin.tv API taken down.
